v001
- Initial release
- Supports only English SOFA Alignment with tgm_sofa

v002
- Fixed linux icon bug
- Updated tgm_sofa to v004
- Changed SOFA inference mode to force from match (gives better results to unseen speakers)

v003
- SOFA_GUI now only has full functionality on Windows
	- this is because of the Japanese G2p relying on a precompiled '.exe' version of OpenJTalk.
- Fully supports Japanese SOFA model by colstone.
- Japanese transcripts are phoneme level, as the best results came from using a G2p as opposed to a dictionary.
- Installation is now 1 step, the "installer.bat" file!
- Huge code overhaul, including:
	- better pipeline for changing display language (destroys the window and rebuilds it)
	- put Whisper + SOFA functions into their own file to keep the code readable
	- removed the need for aria2c and unzip by using gdown and zipfile
	- readme file is a bit more clear
- removed the progress bar because it doesn't work how I want it to :(
