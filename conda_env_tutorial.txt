If you'd prefer to install this using a conda environment, follow these steps:

conda create -n SOFA python=3.8 -y

The following 2 steps will need to be repeated any time you close and reopen the conda prompt window.

conda activate SOFA
cd {path_to_SOFA_GUI_folder}

Next, install whichever version of torch you need. To check which CUDA you are running, type in:
nvidia-smi

torch w cu118:
pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

torch w cu121:
pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

torch w just CPU:
pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

Next, install the rest of the stuff:

pip install openai-whisper customtkinter ftfy gdown

Now, run the "install_assets" script.

python install_assets.py

You will then need to move the two ".ckpt" files into "SOFA/ckpt" for them to function properly.

Now, to run the GUI:

python sofa_gui.py.
